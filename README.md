An app inspired by UI from the game design industry, hopefully accelerating research in the field of particle accelerator optimisation. Drag and drop Process Variable (PV) building blocks, multiple ML models including Single and Multi-task Gaussian Processes (GPs), Variational auto-encoders (VAEs), Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents, and perform standard accelerator operations like Orbit Response Measurements (ORMs), all in one visual interactive editor. Open multiple editors at once to work with several such pipelines in one go. PVs can simulataneously define elements in a real machine as well as be linked to virtual elements inside a model. This allows you to directly compare model to machine, and gives your ML model components access to both real and virtual data pools concurrently. Query the lattice for different elements with the inspector. Filter by element type, and instantly get information on location, index, and class-specific information.
